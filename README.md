Lariat Rent-A-Car (also known as Lariat Auto Rentals in Supernatural and Lariat Rental Car in Veronica Mars) is a car rental company located throughout the United States. The company was mainly featured in The X-Files and made cameo appearances in Breaking Bad, Supernatural and Veronica Mars.
For this project, I was hired to analyze and forecast business strategies to minimize costs and maximize revenue. As a Data Analyst, I was in charge of creating a model Dashboard in Excel and an insightful presentation for Lariat executives.
